# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## Usage

### Adding a changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Versioning

When ready to release, run:

```bash
pnpm version
```

This will:
- Consume all changesets
- Update package versions
- Update changelogs

### Publishing

After versioning, publish with:

```bash
pnpm release
```

This builds all packages and publishes them to npm.
